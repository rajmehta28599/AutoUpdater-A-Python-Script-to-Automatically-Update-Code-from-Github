Generating an Access Token in Github

An access token in Github is used to authenticate and access Github's API. Here's how you can generate an access token:

Go to github.com/settings/tokens and sign in to your Github account.

Click on the "Generate new token" button.

Give your token a name and select the scopes you want your token to have access to. Scopes define what kind of access your token will have, such as read-only access or full access to your repositories.

Click the "Generate token" button.

You will be taken to a page where you can see your newly generated token. Note: This is the only time you will be able to see your token. Make sure to copy it to a safe place as you won't be able to access it again.

Use your token in your code by adding it as a header to your requests. For example, if you are using the PyGithub library, you can add your access token like this:

from github import Github

ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your-access-token'

# Authenticate with Github using your access token
g = Github(ACCESS_TOKEN)

# Use the Github API
# ...
That's it! You can now use your access token to authenticate and access Github's API.
